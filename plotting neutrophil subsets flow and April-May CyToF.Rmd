As of 5Jan16 we have 5 good flow samples using Rena's neutrophil panel and 4  successful CyToF samples from April-May 2015. The CyToF samples were cytobrushes from HVTN clinic and the flow samples are from Dr. Adams-Waldorf. The CyToF panel contained all the same markers as the flow panel, plus a lot more. 

To generate the data used below,I used the following gating schemes:
CyToF: singlets (intercalator1 vs event length)
CD45+ (intercalator1 vs CD45)
live (intercalator1 vs Cisplatin)
neutrophils (CD14 vs CD66b)
neutrophil subsets (CD16 vs CD66b)


Flow: everything but beads (fsc vs ssc)
singlets (fscH vs fscA)
CD45+ (SSC vs CD45)
live (SSC vs L/D)
neutrophils (CD14 vs CD66b)
neutrophil subsets (CD16 vs CD66b)

Then I made freq-of-parent tables from the gates to use here.


```{r}

library(dplyr)
library(reshape2)
library(stringr)
library(ggplot2)


#read in freq table for flow

#go up one folder to GAPPS projects (from GAPPS-analysis) then down to GAPPS 2015 Neutrophils.
flowFreq <- read.csv("../GAPPS 2015 Neutrophils/FLOW freq table.csv")


#I am only interested in the CD66b vs CD16 data, so I will only keep the columns that have those data (7 and 8) and the first column which has the sample names.

#I want all the samples except the first two, 15-133-01, because the voltages were different for that sample and 15-134-01 since we didn't get enough live cells to show meaningful populations. Also I don't want the SD and mean (last 2 rows)

flowFreq<- flowFreq[3:6,c(1,7:8)]

#column names are terrible so I'll change them

colnames(flowFreq)<-c("Sample","CD66b lo CD16 hi","CD66b hi CD16 mid-lo")

#add a column saying what kind of data this is

flowFreq<-flowFreq %>%
  mutate(Type ="Flow Cytometry")

#Change the sample names so they fit better on the x axis
flowFreq$Sample <- c("135","137","138","139")

#now read in the cyToF frequency data

CyToFfreq <- read.csv("J:/MacLabUsers/Claire/Projects/GAPPS Project/GAPPS 2015 Neutrophils/NORMED April-May2015 freq table.csv")

#also want the columns with CD16 CD66b data (6 and 7)and the first column with the names and all the rows except the last 2

CyToFfreq <-CyToFfreq[1:4,c(1,6:7)]


colnames(CyToFfreq)<-c("Sample","CD66b lo CD16 hi","CD66b hi CD16 mid-lo")

#change the sample names to less terrible

CyToFfreq$Sample<- c("4884b","5168","4897","5084")
#add a column saying what kind of data this is

CyToFfreq<-CyToFfreq %>%
  mutate(Type ="Mass Cytometry")




#combine the data sets

combinedData <- rbind(CyToFfreq,flowFreq)

#melt for plotting

meltCombinedData <- melt(combinedData)


names(meltCombinedData)[3:4]<-c("Population","Frequency")

#The frequencies don't add to 100 so Ill make a summary table to calculate that. The column CD66bPos is each frequency divided by the sum of the frequencies


meltCombinedData<-meltCombinedData %>%
  group_by(Sample)%>%
  mutate(total = sum(Frequency))%>%
  mutate(CD66bPos = (Frequency/total)*100)


stackedBar<-ggplot(meltCombinedData, aes(x=Sample, y = CD66bPos))+
  geom_bar(aes(fill = Population),stat="identity")+
  labs(y="Frequency (Percent)")+
  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(vjust=0.8, size=8),
        axis.title=element_text(size= 12),
        legend.title=element_text(size=12),
        axis.title.x=element_text(vjust=.2),
        plot.title = element_text(vjust=2),
        aspect.ratio = 0.6)+
    ggtitle("Frequency of CD66b+ sub-populations")
